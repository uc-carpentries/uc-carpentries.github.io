We are a group of students and staff members at the University of Chicago who teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers at the university. We have been teaching two-day research computing bootcamps at the University of Chicago since 2014.

We started as an initiative of the Biological Sciences Division, but our trained instructors are based in the Biological Sciences, Social Sciences, and Physical Sciences Divisions. Our instructors undergo a rigorous training process to become officially certified [Carpentries instructors](https://carpentries.org/about/). We have taught over 15 workshops over the past 5 years. 

- If you are interested in **attending a workshop**, please see our [Calendar](https://uc-carpentries.github.io/calendar/) for upcoming trainings.

- If you are interested in **requesting a workshop for your department**, please see the [Request Form](https://uc-carpentries.github.io/request-form/) to submit a request for training.

- If you are interested in **receiving training to teach workshops** on Shell, Git, R, Python, and more, please see the [Get Involved](https://uc-carpentries.github.io/get-involved/) page.

- If you are currently an instructor and **looking for resources for your workshops**, please see the [For Instructors](https://uc-carpentries.github.io/get-involved/) page.
